# Lattice model for simulation of lipid and protein interacton

This is the simulation code for the first part of my master thesis. The code helps to simulate a lipid mixture in membrame which is represented by an 2D lattice. The analysis of this model is published in [PRE](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.042410) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08659)). I worked from May 2016 to June 2017 on this project.
